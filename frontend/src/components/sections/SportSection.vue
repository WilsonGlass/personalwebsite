          Division I Coxing — Northeastern Men’s Rowing

          After transferring from the University of San Diego, where I was also on their Division I rowing team, I joined
          Northeastern Men's Crew. I had the opportunity to cox world-class athletes and gain a great deal of knowledge
          about communication and leadership. I do believe that my career as a coxswain translates very well to my
          professional experiences leading teams and explaining technical concepts.
